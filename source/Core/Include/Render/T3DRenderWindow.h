     * @remarks
     *  This class handles a window into which the contents of a scene are
     *  rendered. There is a many-to-1 relationship between instances of this
     *  class an instance of Renderer which controls the rendering of the scene.
     *  There may be more than one window in the case of level editor tools etc.
     *  This class is abstract since there may be different implementations for
     *  different windowing systems.
     * @remarks
     *  Instances are created and communicated with by the render system
     *  although client programs can get a reference to it from the renderer if
     *  required for resizing or moving. Note that you can have multiple
     *  viewpoints in the window for effects like rear-view mirrors and
     *  picture-in-picture views (see Viewport and Camera).
